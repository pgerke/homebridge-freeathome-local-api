## Security

I'm taking the security of my software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through GitHub.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repositories, please report it to me through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to support@philipgerke.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help me better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.
